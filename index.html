        <h1>Freetown Christiania</h1>
        <h2>From commune to co-op</h2>
        <p>In 2004 the government initiated the process of “normalizing” Christiania, i.e. reframing the conditions of the town’s existence in the way that would conform to the city’s property laws and urban plans. In 2011 an agreement was reached that would
            reshape the community and its dealings with Danish authorities. Join us in exploring Christiania as and find out how the new legal conditions affect the community’s political identity and its peculiar place in the Danish society. </p>

                        village in the city. But of course not everyone can handle all the meetings and involvement in every community issue. Some of my friends even moved out because of this.

                    <p class="active_speech">Indeed, there has been much transformation after the Agreement! Before, if there was a poor woman with children, who couldn’t afford housing, we could just assign a house to them. But now, free place is scarce, so one has to pass a
                        rigorous application process and later pay rental fees to live here. With government’s normalization efforts, there is no place for the poor anymore…
                    </p>

                    <p class="description pubpol">The community in Freetown Christiania has been subject to frequent police raids and significant prejudice from the right-wing Danish government. The residents are often viewed as oddities who do not have a place in the “new creative
                        economy” and the “world-class business environment” that the government is attempting to transform Christiania into. Even though the commune has existed for over 40 years, and was for a long time treated almost as a social experiment
                        by the government, new laws are being brought into force to systematically force the residents out (Hansen et. al 2001, Larsen and Hansen 2008).</p>

                    <p class="description env">The specific process of selection of newcomers in Christiania heavily relies on the cycle of recognition, distribution and participation analysed by Schlosberg. As a matter of fact, the application process in Christiania is a clear
                        example in which this cycle plays a pivotal, structural role for the community. In the first place, as soon as a newcomer is selected as “adequate” and therefore admitted as a Christianite, this means that he has been recognised
                        inside the community. Therefore, the other step that Schlosberg talks about is the so-called “ distribution ”; in a second time, the admitted newcomers are provided with a house (a process which would be considered as resource-distribution
                        in terms of environmental justice) in a neighbourhood that they know is similar to their personal profile. Finally, this situation would empower a new Christianite, one that has previously been recognized by the community and is
                        now in possession of specific resources (distributed among the community); this community member would thus be enabled to participate more authentically to the political and social scenario.

                    <br>

                    <p class="description">On March 14, 2007, after facing violent street battles against Christiania activists, the police managed to successfully demolish Cigarkassen (The Cigar Box), a small shed… only to see it raising again the day after, with the famous
                        inscription “The reconstruction team strikes again”! The so-called “reconstruction team” counted 25 to 30 activists, who completed the reconstruction overnight. Cigarkassen then became a symbol of the broader overarching normalization
                        process that the Danish government wanted to impose on the community of Christiania, in order to control it. </p>

                    <p class="description phil">Trust is an essential, crucial element for a healthy democratic system; as Christiano (2012) argues, alarm bells play an important role when trust is violated, sending a clear signal of social injustice or violated rights, for instance.
                        As a matter of fact, there is always competition in a system (represented by the different forms of opposition, protests, critical media and so on) and therefore democracy emerges as a “fragmented, multi-tiered system of deliberation”
                        (Christiano 2012) in which various alternative systems find their harmony and co-existence in a democratic scenario based on the pillars of trust.</p>

                    <p class="description">In 2007, this system based on trust was betrayed: as a matter of fact, the demolition of Cigarkassen was an action that the state took despite the court decision on the issue hadn’t been announced yet (it was announced five days after
                        that episode, and it was in favor of Christiania).</p>

                    <p class="description">Therefore, as pointed out by Hansen (2011) when analysing the Cigarkassen’s episode: “the action could be regarded as an active politics of scale - an important symbol of Christiania’s proactive fight for its ‘right to the city’”.
                        This specific episode could be potentially considered as an alarm bell that the whole community created in order to answer in a coherent, powerful way to the normalizing attempt of the government.</p>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">

                    <p class="description">Freetown Christiania is a self-proclaimed anarchist “eco-village” established in 1971, in downtown Copenhagen, Denmark. The community was formed when residents from the surrounding area broke down fencing around some abandoned military
                        barracks to create a playground for the neighbourhood children, as an act of protest against the Danish government for the high property prices and gentrification in the area (Rasmussen 2018a).</p>

                    <p class="description">Soon after, squatters moved into the abandoned buildings in the compound, setting up a sort of ramshackle hippie commune along the way. At this point, anyone and everyone who was frustrated by the way things were run by the Danish
                        government, or simply wanted to live an alternative lifestyle was allowed to move in and settle in the town. The community aimed to be self-reliant, and the main source of income was the cannabis trade, which was banned elsewhere
                        in the country, but was tolerated in Christiania (Cathcart-Keays 2016). </p>

                    <p class="description">The town has a unique way of self-management, with “residents in an area hav(ing) a common responsibility for the area’s development and condition” (Christiania 2003). The town is organised into “14 local areas”, and each of the divisions
                        is managed by Area Meetings. All important decisions concerning the specific area are taken at these meetings. This level of organisation is succeeded by the Community Meetings in Christiania, which have the highest authority,
                        all the residents are allowed to participate in these meetings and the decisions taken here are binding for all members of the commune (Christiania 2003).</p>

                    <p class="description">For years, the authorities treated Christiania as more of a social experiment and the town signed multiple agreements with the government allowing them to legitimately occupy the land (Goldblatt 2011; Hansen 2011). Most services &
                        businesses in Christiania were communally owned, as the residents were strictly against the idea of private ownership. This arrangement lasted, until the current right-wing government came into power with the idea of “normalizing”
                        Christiania on it’s agenda. “Normalizing” Christiania, is the latest ploy by the government to reduce Christiania’s excesses, while keeping it as a tourist attraction. This plan, apart from being politically motivated, was also
                        an attempt to subdue/drive the residents out, as they occupy a prime real estate location in downtown Copenhagen (Hansen 2011). Finally in 2011, the Christianits formed a Foundation for the town and signed an agreement with the
                        Danish authorities which allowed them to collectively buy and own the land they were living on, -- at below market prices -- transforming from a commune to a co-op (Rasmussen 2018b). </p>

                    <p class="description">However, the 2011 Property Agreement brought with it major changes to the ways of living in Christiania. Our main research question, attempts to explore how some of these changes, have affected political participation, and as a result
                        social justice, among the residents.</p>

                    <p class="description">We wanted to introduce the our analyses in the form of a story, and so at first, the audience is introduced to an image of Christiania’s territory. The map is an interactive one, and clicking on the markers gives the viewer bits of
                        information about the different characters, and the relevant philosophical, legal, political, and/or environmental justice viewpoints, surrounding the 2011 Agreement. In going through the text, art and videos, the viewer is introduced
                        to multivariate perspectives in an way that a traditional academic paper would struggle to achieve. Apart from making the content more engaging, it is an attempt to showcase information in a non-monotonous way, to someone who might
                        not have a background in the field.</p>

                    <p class="description">We wanted to explore the journey of Freetown Christiania from a commune to a co-op, with a peculiar story-telling strategy, in which the pivotal concept of social justice and political participation would emerge through different philosophical,
                        political, legal and environmental nuances; in particular considering how those changed after the main turning point of the 2011 Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">The 2011 Agreement has definitely led to the “normalisation” of Christiania, among other things. The commune, which was initially established under anarchist principles, has nowadays turned into a more “exclusive” community, which
                        is currently considerably harder to join. Due to the building restrictions stipulated by the 2011 Property Agreement, the residents are no longer allowed to build new permanent housing. This agreement directly affected the community
                        by limiting the number of residents that can live in the town, therefore resulting in a normalization of Christiania.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Currently, applicants who are willing to live in the community must undergo a complex selection process, also because the space available for residence is very limited; as a matter of fact, vacancies only open up if a current residents
                        dies or moves out. Very often there are large waiting lists, and the newcomers undergo a long and really peculiar application process; this involves, among other criteria, looking at the specific newcomers’ creative and artistic
                        skills as well as their amount of enthusiasm shown to live in Christiania. In conclusion, in order for the newcomers to be finally confirmed as permanent residents, they have to be approved by an unanimous vote at the relevant
                        neighbourhood’s community meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">In order to analyze political participation, it must be said that Christianites are often proud of their system of self-governance based on the pivotal concept of consensus democracy. All important decisions which affect the community
                        as a whole are implemented only if there is unanimous approval by all the residents.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">However, the current selection process raises questions about the legitimacy of this governance process. Since new residents are being so comprehensively vetted, it is highly likely that by doing so the community is effectively shutting
                        out dissent by only allowing residency to those applicants who conform to their views. While on the one hand it might sound reasonable that residents of such a small community should be able to choose who gets to join them, on
                        the other hand, this goes against the anti-establishment principles which constituted the core of Christiania’s original manifesto.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">In order to build our project on robust foundations, we decided to draw on the existing literature in order to engage different perspectives, while narrating a cohesive story. By meeting the people and the places that characterize
                        Christiania, the viewers are also introduced to many interesting concepts that help understanding the philosophical, legal, public policy and environmental justice aspects of the community. Christiano’s alarm bells (Christiano
                        2012), the cycle of recognition, distribution and participation theorized by Schlosberg (2003), the median policy preference theory, the reframing of Christiania’s issues through the specific legal rights’ lenses and much more
                        is what we believe gives a multi-disciplinary, holistic background and explanation to our story-telling process.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">In order to conclude, we found a cohesive conclusion in an Italian article written by Coppola and Vanolo, which analyses not only Christiania and its specific system of differentiated residents’ rights, but also focusing on what the
                        authors define as a “differentiated citizenship”. As a matter of fact, Coppola and Vanolo (2014) argue that the community of Christiania is characterised by a “differentiated citizenship” (similar to what Centner (2012) defines
                        as a “localized micro-citizenship”) as its residents are being exposed to what the authors define as a multi-scale, cross-scale process which is currently aiming to create political space and political opportunity in order to effectively
                        implement a new level of (g)local governance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">It is yet interesting to notice how similar demands of auto-determination and auto-governance are currently emerging across Europe on a regional and local scale, as a rejection of systems of welfare which are nationally regulated.
                        The main driver of these processes is - almost everywhere (as well as in our specific case-study) - the desire of creating a coherent, homogeneous social reality.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Therefore, as Coppola and Vanolo (2014) conclude, the whole idea of autonomy is no longer characterised by a total, mostly conflictual separation from the state apparatus and institutions. A new idea of autonomy has been emerging,
                        and it is being reframed as a practice that aims to preserve some margins of sovereignty in order to effectively tackle local issues (by remaining in a certain overarching state-system).
                    </p>

                    <p class="active_speech">I know Christiania all too well… I was part of the negotiations resulting in the 2011 Agreement between the government and Christiania. Those were horrible months, trying to negotiate with an entity, which has to deliberate on every
                        issue for weeks… It was a great moment when they established the Christiania Foundation, which brought productive change to the process, by giving a legal personality to the community. Well, Christiania is a tricky question for
                        every government, given its abnormal way of life in the middle of our prospering city, but also being a major tourist destination, so you have to balance discontent and budget concerns. This is exactly what our normalization plan
                        is achieving!
                    </p>

                    <p class="description law">There are clear attempts to gentrify the area, as Christiania occupies prime real estate in downtown Copenhagen. Moreover, it is a case of infringing on the residents’ “rights to the city”, and their right to live a different way of
                        life (Hansen 2011). But, on the other hand, there is some potential for the residents to use this period of urban transformation as a chance to claim their ‘right’ to live on the land they have called home for over 40 years (Scheingold
                        1974; Lefebvre 1996) . </p>

                    <p class="description">Since the 2011 Agreement with the State, the appearance of an empty dwelling is rare, given that the building of new houses requires significant payments to the government. Previously, housing was simply distributed to all who needed
                        it and wanted to live there; everyone had the opportunity to build a house of their taste (Coppola and Vanolo 2014). </p>

                    <p class="description">Now the community is significantly more closed, a dwelling usually only becomes free when the original inhabitants either die, or move out. Since a large number of people want to be a part of Freetown Chrisitania, the situation has
                        resulted in a rigorous application process. Any new resident is evaluated on a range of criteria, and must be approved by an unanimous vote at the concerned neighbourhood committee. This is any extremely time consuming process,
                        the approval of a single application sometimes requiring upto 400 man hours to process (Wang 2016).

                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">

                    <p class="description"> Christiania’s political participation is based on direct participation and consensus decision making. There are various committees (‘meetings’), which coordinate different aspects of the Free Town’s life in a horizontal manner and
                        are open to any Christianite to join. These include the economic-meeting (Christiania budget), corporate-meeting (managing daily issues of businesses), building-meeting (maintenance of common facilities) and many others, with the
                        community-meeting at the top of the hierarchy, with the participation of all Christianites and its decisions applicable to everyone.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">In evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the system, it is useful to analyze the threefold claim of democratic triumphalism: epistemic/instrumental, aretaic and intrinsic value and point to some of the system’s challenges, following
                        Brennan’s footsteps.(Brennan 2016). Epistemically, the system allows for proper deliberation, which is at the core of democratic governance, as well as the pooling of knowledge amongst people with various backgrounds and occupations
                        (Landemore 2012). Moreover, given consensus decision making, at the end of the day, everyone is supposed to be satisfied with the outcome. Instrumentally, it apparently results in valuable outcomes, for example their award winning
                        local development plan. From an aretaic point of view, it pushes people to listen to and consider each others opinion. Finally, the systems intrinsic value lies in the fact that allows everyone to participate in decision making
                        to the extent they prefer to.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">On the other hand, however, a major instrumental weakness is the slow pace of decision making, consuming great amount of time from participants and preventing quick responses to urgent problems. Furthermore, in an aretaic sense, as
                        an ex-residence pointed out, meetings sometimes involve much shouting and aggression, which underscores Brennan’s point that democracy not always ennobles people. Finally, and as Brennan (2016) points out, knowledge pooling does
                        not necessarily result in better decisions, and it is not necessarily just to require everyone’s participation. </p>
                    <p class="description">Hence, there has to be some crucial factors, which make Christiania’s politcal system work as it is.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why the political system works? </h2>
                    <p class="description">Drawing on insights of political economy, one can point to some crucial factors, which enable the Free Town to maintain a system of direct democracy, which can mostly provide justice within political participation. Most vital is participation
                        in the political structures. In ‘usual’ democracies, electoral participation is far from 100% with a strong bias towards the richer strata, which influences policy outcomes (Bonica et. al 2013). Drawing on Solt, two reasons stand
                        out in accounting for this (Solt 2008). First, as resource theory shows, richer people can more often prevail in political discussions, exclude topics desired by the poor and ultimately develop a feeling of disenfranchisement in
                        them. Contrary to that, in Christiania everyone can participate in any meeting, discussing and raising desired questions, as well as veto decisions, apparently resulting in a sense of ultimate enfranchisement, as described by some
                        Christianites, when referring to the significant 2011 deal as something subject to their direct approval.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Second, from the resource theory point of view, poor people can generally participate less in political debate, given their lack of resources to let and maintain their voice to be heard. In Christiania, the only resource needed is
                        the time of the meetings, thus allowing for easy participation. Moreover, wealth difference is much less significant between Christianites than outside of the Free Town, coupled with a low sum of redistributed money, and less policy
                        issues, being dependent on the Danish government in multiple areas; therefore the arena for disagreement is massively reduced.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Finally, if considering the psychological aspect of participation, Christianites consciously raise their children in a free, communal and participatory way, as well as pick their new fellow citizens according to their willingness to
                        participate, therefore enhancing participation (Wasshede 2017). Moreover, as Smets and van Ham shows, participation declines with aging, gradually increasing the unrepresented population part, which, in case of Christiania is often
                        solved by older people moving out from the Free Town, when becoming wary of all the meetings (Smets et. al 2013).
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">These tendencies, then, acts as homogenizers, resulting ultimately in high rates of participation and convergence of viewpoints, therefore enabling a consensus based direct democracy to work.

                    <p class="description env">Distribution of resources can be unequal even in case of full recognition and political participation, as apparent from the case of access to water. At the beginning of the Free Town, access was equal, having only one bath for everyone,
                        however, as time evolved, some better equipped houses acquired own water systems, resulting in disparities (Coppola and Vanolo 2014).</p>

                    <p class="description phil">Providing opportunity for this disparity is the fact of Christiania’s partial openness towards the outside world. Drawing on Fraser’s insights on the structural constraints of an individual’s quality of life, one can point out, that
                        despite having to start a new life in terms of residence, when moving to Christiania, previous background stays with Christianites in forms of accumulated wealth, knowledge, skills, and occupation, given that a great amount of
                        Christianites work outside Christiania, allowing them to afford different lifestyles (Dahl et. al 2004).</p>

                    <p>The last Danish execution site, active from 1946 to 1950, can still be seen on the Second Redan close to the building called Aircondition. The wooden execution shed is gone, but the concrete foundation and a drain for the blood remain
                        just next to the path. In total, 29 World War II criminals were executed on the site. The last was Ib Birkedal, a high-level Danish Gestapo collaborator, on 20 July 1950.

                    <p class="description">In order to introduce the current taxation system, it is important to notice that after the 2011 Agreement with the government, taxation was no longer just a mean of regulating the inner economic reality, regarding the community of
                        Christiania. After the Agreement, the outside dimension was greatly emphasized, because of the need of paying off the bank mortgage.</p>
                    <p class="description pubpol">Both the old and the new taxation system could be considered as one of the causes of the perpetuation of socio-economic inequality in the sense that they both apply a flat tax rate; by doing this, they leave the richer with more disposable
                        income than the poor, meaning that some policies cannot be changed even by full participation. Moreover, in order to cite Solt, “because it increases the relative power of richer citizens, economic inequality undermines political
                        equality”. As a matter of fact, Solt argues that economic inequality “works to sharply depress interest in politics” among the poorer citizens. Therefore, since the poorest citizens’ interests are not being represented (as they
                        chose not to take participation in the political process), the median policy preference hence shifts into a non-representative and misleading (but still democratic) outcome. Given that direct participation is hedging this disparity,
                        the system is operating smoothly so far, however, as the existence of the flat tax rate shows, there are some policy issues, where the interest of the rich already dominates the poor, therefore it is advisable for Christianites
                        to keep in mind this potential threat of divergence.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description">Thus, in order to address the topic of the economic redistribution in Christiania by again citing Solt’s article: “one’s political engagement is shaped not only by how much money one has, but also by how much money everyone else has”.
                        Therefore it seems impossible to ignore the broader overarching socio-economic context when considering political engagement, also in a really small community as Christiania’s.</p>
