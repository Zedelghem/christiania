                    <p class="active_speech">Indeed, there has been much transformation after the Agreement! Before, if there was a poor woman with children, who couldn’t afford housing, we could just assign a house to them. But now, free place is scarce, so one has to pass a
                        rigorous application process and later pay rental fees to live here. With government’s normalization efforts, there is no place for the poor anymore…
                    </p>

                    <p class="description pubpol">The community in Freetown Christiania has been subject to frequent police raids and significant prejudice from the right-wing Danish government. The residents are often viewed as oddities who do not have a place in the “new creative
                        economy” and the “world-class business environment” that the government is attempting to transform Christiania into. Even though the commune has existed for over 40 years, and was for a long time treated almost as a social experiment
                        by the government, new laws are being brought into force to systematically force the residents out.</p>

                    <p class="description law">There are clear attempts to gentrify the area, as Christiania occupies prime real estate in downtown Copenhagen (Hansen et. al 2001, Larsen and Hansen 2008). Moreover, it is a case of infringing on the residents’ “rights to the city”,
                        and their right to live a different way of life (Hansen 2011). But, on the other hand, there is some potential for the residents to use this period of urban transformation as a chance to claim their ‘right’ to live on the land
                        they have called home for over 40 years (Scheingold 1974; Lefebvre 1996) . </p>

                    <p class="description env">The specific process of selection of newcomers in Christiania heavily relies on the cycle of recognition, distribution and participation analysed by Schlosberg. As a matter of fact, the application process in Christiania is a clear
                        example in which this cycle plays a pivotal, structural role for the community. In the first place, as soon as a newcomer is selected as “adequate” and therefore admitted as a Christianite, this means that he has been recognised
                        inside the community. Therefore, the other step that Schlosberg talks about is the so-called “ distribution ”; in a second time, the admitted newcomers are provided with a house (a process which would be considered as resource-distribution
                        in terms of environmental justice) in a neighbourhood that they know is similar to their personal profile. Finally, this situation would empower a new Christianite, one that has previously been recognized by the community and is
                        now in possession of specific resources (distributed among the community); this community member would thus be enabled to participate more authentically to the political and social scenario.

                    <p class="active_speech">Oh, and the violence in this city! I was directly involved in those street battles, when the historical <i>Cigarkassen</i> episode took place, in 2007!</p>
                    <br>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDsZwdCO2Mo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                    <p class="description">On March 14, 2007, after facing violent street battles against Christiania activists, the police managed to successfully demolish Cigarkassen (The Cigar Box), a small shed… only to see it raising again the day after, with the famous
                        inscription “The reconstruction team strikes again”! The so-called “reconstruction team” counted 25 to 30 activists, who completed the reconstruction overnight. Cigarkassen then became a symbol of the broader overarching normalization
                        process that the Danish government wanted to impose on the community of Christiania, in order to control it. </p>

                    <p class="description phil">Trust is an essential, crucial element for a healthy democratic system; as Christiano (2012) argues, alarm bells play an important role when trust is violated, sending a clear signal of social injustice or violated rights, for instance.
                        As a matter of fact, there is always competition in a system (represented by the different forms of opposition, protests, critical media and so on) and therefore democracy emerges as a “fragmented, multi-tiered system of deliberation”
                        (Christiano 2012) in which various alternative systems find their harmony and co-existence in a democratic scenario based on the pillars of trust.</p>

                    <p class="description">In 2007, this system based on trust was betrayed: as a matter of fact, the demolition of Cigarkassen was an action that the state took despite the court decision on the issue hadn’t been announced yet (it was announced five days after
                        that episode, and it was in favor of Christiania).</p>

                    <p class="description">Therefore, as pointed out by Hansen (2011) when analysing the Cigarkassen’s episode: “the action could be regarded as an active politics of scale - an important symbol of Christiania’s proactive fight for its ‘right to the city’”.
                        This specific episode could be potentially considered as an alarm bell that the whole community created in order to answer in a coherent, powerful way to the normalizing attempt of the government.</p>

                    <p class="description">Since the 2011 Agreement with the State, the appearance of an empty dwelling is rare, given that the building of new houses requires significant payments to the government. Previously, housing was simply distributed to all who needed
                        it and wanted to live there; everyone had the opportunity to build a house of their taste (Coppola and Vanolo 2014). </p>

                    <p class="description">Now the community is significantly more closed, a dwelling usually only becomes free when the original inhabitants either die, or move out. Since a large number of people want to be a part of Freetown Chrisitania, the situation has
                        resulted in a rigorous application process. Any new resident is evaluated on a range of criteria, and must be approved by an unanimous vote at the concerned neighbourhood committee. This is any extremely time consuming process,
                        the approval of a single application sometimes requiring upto 400 man hours to process (Wang 2016).

                        however, as time evolved, some better equipped houses acquired own water systems, resulting in disparities (Coppola and Vanolo 2014).</p>

                    <p class="description phil">Providing opportunity for this disparity is the fact of Christiania’s partial openness towards the outside world. Drawing on Fraser’s insights on the structural constraints of an individual’s quality of life, one can point out, that
                        despite having to start a new life in terms of residence, when moving to Christiania, previous background stays with Christianites in forms of accumulated wealth, knowledge, skills, and occupation, given that a great amount of
                        Christianites work outside Christiania, allowing them to afford different lifestyles (Dahl et. al 2004).</p>

                    <p>The last Danish execution site, active from 1946 to 1950, can still be seen on the Second Redan close to the building called Aircondition. The wooden execution shed is gone, but the concrete foundation and a drain for the blood remain
                        just next to the path. In total, 29 World War II criminals were executed on the site. The last was Ib Birkedal, a high-level Danish Gestapo collaborator, on 20 July 1950.

                    <p class="description">In order to introduce the current taxation system, it is important to notice that after the 2011 Agreement with the government, taxation was no longer just a mean of regulating the inner economic reality, regarding the community of
                        Christiania. After the Agreement, the outside dimension was greatly emphasized, because of the need of paying off the bank mortgage.</p>
                    <p class="description pubpol">Both the old and the new taxation system could be considered as one of the causes of the perpetuation of socio-economic inequality in the sense that they both apply a flat tax rate; by doing this, they leave the richer with more disposable
                        income than the poor, meaning that some policies cannot be changed even by full participation. Moreover, in order to cite Solt, “because it increases the relative power of richer citizens, economic inequality undermines political
                        equality”. As a matter of fact, Solt argues that economic inequality “works to sharply depress interest in politics” among the poorer citizens. Therefore, since the poorest citizens’ interests are not being represented (as they
                        chose not to take participation in the political process), the median policy preference hence shifts into a non-representative and misleading (but still democratic) outcome. Given that direct participation is hedging this disparity,
                        the system is operating smoothly so far, however, as the existence of the flat tax rate shows, there are some policy issues, where the interest of the rich already dominates the poor, therefore it is advisable for Christianites
                        to keep in mind this potential threat of divergence.
                    </p>

                    <p class="description">Thus, in order to address the topic of the economic redistribution in Christiania by again citing Solt’s article: “one’s political engagement is shaped not only by how much money one has, but also by how much money everyone else has”.
                        Therefore it seems impossible to ignore the broader overarching socio-economic context when considering political engagement, also in a really small community as Christiania’s.</p>
