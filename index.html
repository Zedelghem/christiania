                    <p class="active_speech">Indeed, there has been much transformation after the Agreement! Before, if there was a poor woman with children, who couldn’t afford housing, we could just assign a house to them. But now, free place is scarce, so one has to pass a

                    <p class="description pubpol">The community in Freetown Christiania has been subject to frequent police raids and significant prejudice from the right-wing Danish government. The residents are often viewed as oddities who do not have a place in the “new creative
                        economy” and the “world-class business environment” that the government is attempting to transform Christiania into. Even though the commune has existed for over 40 years, and was for a long time treated almost as a social experiment
                        by the government, new laws are being brought into force to systematically force the residents out.</p>

                    <p class="description law">There are clear attempts to gentrify the area, as Christiania occupies prime real estate in downtown Copenhagen (Hansen et. al 2001, Larsen and Hansen 2008). Moreover, it is a case of infringing on the residents’ “rights to the city”,
                        and their right to live a different way of life (Hansen 2011). But, on the other hand, there is some potential for the residents to use this period of urban transformation as a chance to claim their ‘right’ to live on the land
                        they have called home for over 40 years (Scheingold 1974; Lefebvre 1996) . </p>

                        just next to the path. In total, 29 World War II criminals were executed on the site. The last was Ib Birkedal, a high-level Danish Gestapo collaborator, on 20 July 1950.
